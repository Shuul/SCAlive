<!-- 
    TODO:
    we might get a lot from making mixed shipgroups(especially ones that include ships from shipmods) 
    so we make groups here and in ships.xml give them tags but leave the actual use of those jobs/md thigns 
    to be in another mod like 
    SCAlive_ship_exapansion
    that way we can set a dependency on just that submod to listen for whatever ship mods we support
